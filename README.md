# Email-Directory-Program
This is a program that can find emails, add emails, change emails, and delete emails, obtained from an external text file.    

# How The Program works
Users have a choice between 5 options to choose from. Each option has an explanation of what it does. For example, if the user selects option 1, the program looks for a specific email. The program then asks the user to enter an email. If the email is found the program then states that the email exists or else it states not found. 

Users can select option 2 which allows the user to add a new name and email. For example, if the user selects option 2 the program would then say enter a name and email. Once the user inputs this information, the program then adds the name and email. 

option 3 allows the user to change an existing email and option 4 allows the user to delete an email address. the process of these two options is similar to the previous option which allows for the user to input the name and email address. 

All the information regarding the email are stored in a external .txt file
